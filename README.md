The COVID-19 pandemic has significantly disrupted academic activities globally, affecting 213 countries. In Bangladesh, higher education institutions are using online systems to bridge the study gap, but mobile learning is underutilized at the secondary level. This project aims to support students, teachers, and schools with an ad-free mobile app accessible via the internet. The app will feature a real-time database of past exam questions, enabling students to prepare for exams and engage with teachers and peers. It aims to enhance confidence, provide academic notices, and revolutionize traditional education, ensuring proper academic activities in Bangladesh.
